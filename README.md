## 🎉 HueHive was submitted to the 2023 Supabase AI hackathon! 🎉

We are excited to have participated in the Supabase AI hackathon and to have had the opportunity to showcase HueHive. Our goal was to create a powerful tool that would help designers and developers         easily generate stunning color schemes for their projects using the latest AI technologies.

We would like to thank the Supabase team for organizing this hackathon and providing a platform for developers to showcase their skills and creativity. We look forward to participating in future events and continuing to improve HueHive with new features and capabilities. 

👏 Thank you for your support and encouragement! 👏

🎨 Color Inspiration: HueHive generates beautiful color palettes based on the information you provide. The AI algorithm uses natural language processing to understand your design ideas and preferences, and then suggests unique color schemes that will bring your vision to life.

💾 Save and Preview: Once you have found a color scheme that you love, you can save it and preview it on a customizable dashboard template. This will give you a better idea of how your color choices will look in action, allowing you to make informed decisions about your design.

🎨 Customize Your Palette: HueHive also provides an extensive library of over 800 unique colors to choose from, allowing you to build custom color palettes that perfectly suit your needs. Whether you're looking for something bold and vibrant or subtle and understated, HueHive has you covered.

🚀 Technologies Used: HueHive was built using Next.js and TypeScript for a smooth and seamless user experience. The GPT-4 API provides powerful natural language processing capabilities, while MaterialUI and Core UI are used for beautiful and responsive design.

📄 Getting Started: To get started with HueHive, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the required dependencies. You will also need to set up an API key for the GPT-4 API, which can be obtained from the OpenAI website. Once you have everything set up, run `npm run dev` to launch the development server and start exploring HueHive!
